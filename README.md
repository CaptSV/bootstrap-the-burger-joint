# Bootstrap The Burger Joint

A simple, responsive website template for a burger restaurant built using Bootstrap.

## Description

This project is a website template designed specifically for a burger joint. It leverages the power and flexibility of the Bootstrap CSS framework to provide a responsive and visually appealing layout. The template likely includes common elements found on restaurant websites, such as a menu display, information about the restaurant, contact details, and an order section. It serves as a practical example of how Bootstrap can be used to quickly create a professional-looking website for a food-related business.

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

* A web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, etc.) to view the HTML files.
* No specific operating system is required as this is a front-end template.

### Installing

1.  Navigate to the repository page on GitHub: [https://github.com/CaptSV/bootstrap-the-burger-joint](https://github.com/CaptSV/bootstrap-the-burger-joint).
2.  Click on the "Code" button and choose your preferred method of downloading:
    * **Clone the repository:**

        ```
    * **Download as a ZIP file:** Click "Download ZIP" and extract the contents to your desired location.
3.  No specific modifications to files or folders are strictly required to view the template. However, you will likely want to edit the HTML files (e.g., `index.html`) to customize the content with your own burger joint's information, menu, and images.

### Executing program

2.  Locate the main HTML file (named `index.html`).
3.  Double-click the `index.html` file. This will open the website template in your default web browser.

## Help

If you encounter any issues:

* Ensure that your web browser is up to date.

* If you are making modifications and something breaks, try reverting to the original files to identify the source of the problem.
